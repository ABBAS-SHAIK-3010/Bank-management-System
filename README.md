Bank Management System

The Bank Management System is a desktop-based application designed to manage basic banking operations with a secure login system. Developed using Java (JFrame) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, it integrates with a MySQL database for storing and managing user account details and transactions.

The application provides essential banking functions through a simple and intuitive GUI, making it easy for users to interact with the system. Its core features include:

User Authentication: Secure login and signup system for account creation and access.

Deposit Transactions: Allows users to deposit money into their account, updating the stored balance in the database.

Withdrawal Transactions: Enables users to withdraw funds, with the database reflecting updated balances.

Account Management: Signup process automatically creates a new user account in the database.

The system follows a modular design, separating the graphical interface from backend logic and database operations. By applying OOP concepts such as encapsulation and inheritance, the code remains organized, maintainable, and reusable.

The GUI is built using JFrame components such as text fields, buttons, and labels, offering a clean and user-friendly layout. The MySQL database is connected to the application to store account credentials, transaction records, and updated balances securely. All changes are immediately reflected in the database through SQL queries.

This project demonstrates skills in Java programming, GUI development, MySQL integration, and basic banking process automation. It serves as a functional prototype for small-scale banking operations and can be extended with additional features like transaction history, balance inquiry, or role-based access control for larger implementations.
