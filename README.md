# Bank-management-System
# 💼 Bank Management System (Java)

A simple, modular banking application built using **Java Swing (JFrame)** and connected to a **MySQL database**.  
This project is still in development, but it's designed to simulate core banking operations with a focus on clean design, OOP principles, and future scalability.

## 🚀 Project Status: In Progress

I'm currently developing this system as part of my journey to strengthen my backend development skills, particularly using **Java + SQL**. The app already supports several key operations and is being expanded to include more advanced features and better security practices.

## ✨ Features Implemented 

- 🔐 Account Management & Security
  - New User Signup: Securely create a new bank account with personal details.

  - Multiple Account Types: Support for both 'Savings' and 'Current' accounts during signup.

  - User Authentication: Login system using a unique card number and a secure PIN.

  - PIN Change: Users can update their account PIN at any time.

- 💰 Transaction Operations
  - Deposit: Add funds to an account, with the transaction history updated in real-time.

  - Withdrawal: Withdraw a custom amount, with checks for sufficient balance.

  - Fast Cash: Quickly withdraw predefined amounts (e.g., ₹500, ₹1000, ₹2000) for convenience.

  - Fund Transfer: Transfer money securely to another bank account within the system.

- 📊 Account Information & History
  - Balance Enquiry: Check the current account balance instantly.

  - Bank Statement: Generate and view a mini-statement of recent transactions.

- 🖥️ **Desktop GUI**
  - Built using **JFrame** (Java Swing), with labeled fields and buttons for interaction

- 🧠 **Object-Oriented Design**
  - Java classes are organized using OOP principles: encapsulation, modularity, and reusability

- 🗄️ **Database Integration**
  - Uses MySQL to store, retrieve, and update user and transaction data

## 📌 Why This Project

This project is my attempt to apply core Java programming in a real-world use case.  
It challenges me to think like a backend developer, handle persistent data storage, manage user input securely, and design interfaces that are easy to use.

My main goals with this project:
- Strengthen my understanding of **Java and JDBC**
- Practice connecting front-end (GUI) with backend (SQL)
- Build something functional that could evolve into a more complex system
